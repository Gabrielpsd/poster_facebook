# A tool that uses GraphAPI from META to connect to a Facebook page and publish content

This tool was built in pure PHP and uses the CURL library to handle all requests.
To save and generate the URLs of the media to be published, AWS services were used.
The publications and logins are stored in a MySQL database, and all the scripts needed to create the tables are in the "setupEnvironment" folder.

## Usage of the Tool
The tool was designed to be an API that was incorporated into a WebShop system. This way, the shop owner could create and publish content directly from their system.

## Instagram
The first version of the app was built to post on an Instagram account that was linked to a business page on Facebook. Later, Meta introduced a method to log in directly to an Instagram account.
That's why there are two login methods in this app.
